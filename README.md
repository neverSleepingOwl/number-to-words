# number-to-words
Program which converts integers to string, that contains integers, written using words in Russian cursive.(Sample: 123->"Sto dvadsat' tri").To make this programm useful for English words, you need to replace string constants and rewrite function:correct_word_endings.
Code is pretty messed up, without using any of OOP principles, I've uploaded this project like a HelloWorld project on github,
but I hope it would be useful for someone.
